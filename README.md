The "Apartment Management System" is a command-line program designed to manage apartment records. The program allows users to perform four main actions: create, read, update, and delete apartment records. Upon execution, the user is presented with a menu of options, including creating a new apartment record, reading an existing record, updating an existing record, or deleting an existing record. The program prompts the user for necessary information such as apartment number, resident's first and last names, lease start and end dates, and balance. It then stores this information in a file. If a record already exists for the given apartment number, the program prompts the user to update the existing record or create a new one. The program also includes error handling to notify the user if an invalid option is selected or if the file cannot be opened. Additionally, the program is accompanied by a Makefile, which compiles the source code and produces an executable. The Makefile also includes a "clean" target to remove the executable file. Overall, the "Apartment Management System" provides a straightforward means of managing apartment records through a simple and intuitive command-line interface, supported by a Makefile for easy compilation and execution.
